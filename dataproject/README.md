# Dataproject

"Should contain a short introduction to your project, and show how to produce your results."

The dataproject notebook file, is called NX31_Data_Project.ipynb.
It contains a data analysis project where we investigate employment both in the public and private sector.
For the public sector we have also include the subsections.
The notebook should run only using known packages from the clases in NumEcon. 
Just make sure you have internet connetion :)

Best regards, NX31.
